Visualizing the pandemic: comparing trajectories of COVID-19 across countries
-------------------

Wrangling and visualizing temporal data presents unique challenges to data analysists. This 1-hour workshop addresses the key tasks involved in exploration of timeseries and walks the participants through an applied example of obtaining COVID-19 mortality data from a live source (https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19) using an Application Programming Interface (API), computing relative timelines and various temporal metrics for individual countries, and designing  information displays for understanding global trends. Data and scripts are provided. Software requirements: R, RStudio, and tidyverse packages. Accompanying GitHub repository: https://github.com/andkov/vada-2020-summer-school
